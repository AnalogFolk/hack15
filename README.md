# How can we use digital to make the analog experience of transport better?

## FOCUS ON TRAVELLING AROUND LONDON

* We're talking about any means of getting around London – this can focus on one means of transport or a combination of many
* You are not limited to existing transport companies (London Underground, Santander Bikes) - walking, cycling, scooters, cabs etc. are also ways to get around
* Think you can improve current services?
* Feel free to use, collaborate and build upon existing products (such as Citymapper, TFL Journey Planner...)


1. Faster: How can you get from A to B in the quickest, most efficient way?
2. Cheaper: How can you travel in the most cost effective way without compromising efficiency?
3. Greener: How can you create less waste, emissions and pollution and help towards a cleaner journey?
4. Safer: How can you improve the safety of travelling around London?

----------

## Rules 
**The rules are simple:**

1. Maximum of 5 people in a team (minimum of 2) 
2. All code must be checked into a team repo inside AnalogFolk's open source GitHub account throughout the day 
3. Hacking must stop at **20:00 on 04/07/15** for presentations and judging

*The teams will be judged against their effectiveness to answer the brief, technical innovation and speed to prototype.*

Taking place at the agency's London offices in Clerkenwell, the Hack event is open to both individuals and teams. The Hack brief will be revealed in the days running up to the event.

Throughout the festival we'll have the best technical and creative minds providing guidance on a variety of technologies and movements.
We'll have some great pieces of technology available to play with. Including Apple Watch, Leap Motion, Oculus Rift, Kinect, and Quadcopter Drones.

The doors open at 09:00 and after a full day of hacking and making things judging will take place at 20:45, followed by an awards presentation and drinks.
